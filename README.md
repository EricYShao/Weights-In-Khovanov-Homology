# Khovanov Homology and Quantum Error Code Research
Calculates the matrices for differential maps of chain complexes of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation, and calculates the minimum CSS distance using Audoux's basis elements.

This can also calculate the matrices in Annular Khovanov Homology for the differential maps of chain complexes of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation and information about edges that bound each face in the planar graph.

## For Mac Users 
Download the executables you want to run from the `mac_binaries` directory. The executables `one` and `two` compute the unreduced and reduced distance (for comparisons). 

Once you download those, open the terminal and navigate to their location, and give them permissions
to run with the following command: `sudo chmod 775 ./<name>` and type your password when prompted.
Then, open the location in Finder and click "open with", and select the terminal. This should allow
you to run the program from any terminal instance afterwards.
