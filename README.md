# Khovanov Homology and Quantum Error Code Research
Calculates the matrices for differential maps of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation, and calculates the minimum CSS distance using Audoux's basis elements.

Differentials can be calculated by downloading either of the .exe files, and encoding a link diagram in planar diagram notation in input.txt, where each line has four space-separated positive integers denoting a crossing. For reduced Khovanov homology, the strand labelled by 1 has the marked point. The differential matrices are then generated in output.txt.
