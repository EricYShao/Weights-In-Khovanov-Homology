# Khovanov Homology and Quantum Error Code Research
Calculates the matrices for differential maps of chain complexes of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation, and calculates the minimum CSS distance using Audoux's basis elements.

This can also calculate the matrices in Annular Khovanov Homology for the differential maps of chain complexes of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation and information about edges that bound each face in the planar graph.
