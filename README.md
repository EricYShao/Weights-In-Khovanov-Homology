# Khovanov Homology and Quantum Error Code Research
Calculates the matrices for differential maps of link diagrams when given Planar Diagram notation, and calculates the minimum CSS distance using Audoux's basis elements.

Differentials can be calculated by downloading either of the .exe files, and encoding a link diagram in planar diagram notation in input.txt (the first line should be the number of crossings, followed by 4 space-separated numbers for each crossing). The differential matrices are then generated in output.txt.
